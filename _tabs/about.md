I write prayers, poems, and prose, sometimes.

I go by various names, but you can call me Jon.

The name of this site is based on a piece of advice that CS Lewis once wrote to
a childhood friend:

> Whenever you are fed up with life, start writing: ink is the great cure for
> all human ills, as I have found out long ago.
