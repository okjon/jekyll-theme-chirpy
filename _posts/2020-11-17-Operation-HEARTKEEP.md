Subject: Operation HEARTKEEP  

Agent Ferrante,  

Following the success of Operation TIEKNOT, your next mission will be to maintain the undivided interest of the Minister of War & Finance.

You have been allocated an inventory of weapons which you may wish to employ at your discretion.  

These include fine wine, chocolate, cuddles, active listening, displays of chivalry, guffaw inducement through tickling, putting the toilet set down, breaking beds, and unconditional love.  

Should you wish to accept, I trust you will carry out the mission with gusto and the utmost care.  

Godspeed,  

Mr Ok
Secretary for the Department of Peacekeeping
