> I wrote this for her who was carrying our first child, whose prebirth name is Zuki 

He who knit you in your motherâ€™s womb

Now from inside you makes another room

For a growing joy that moves and kicks

Who of toys and flowers in due course picks

Crying it may when milk it seeks

Trying you may to fill its cheeks

Brought into this world by sweat and tears

Taught of this world by words it hears

May its mouth be full and yours of laughter

Pray its heart be kind and love sought after
