> Inspired by Tom Whitwell's [52 things I learned series](https://medium.com/magnetic/52-things-i-learned-in-2022-db5fcd4aea6e), in no particular order.

1. There are few analogues to the pure, unadulterated joy of witnessing your own flesh and blood mirroring the same feeling

2. Setting a small and defined list of overarching goals for your life can help focus it

[3.](https://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1259) Neurons that fire together wire together, but you need not be a slave to them

4. ‘Eunoia’ refers to a feeling of goodwill, particularly between a speaker and their audience

5. Spent well, a sabbatical can better shape the direction of the rest of your life

6. Jesus was likely not born in an actual manger
