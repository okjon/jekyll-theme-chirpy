2. Setting a small and defined list of overarching goals for your life can help focus it

3. Neurons that fire together wire together, but you need not be a slave to them [*](https://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1259) 

4. ‘Eunoia’ refers to a feeling of goodwill, particularly between a speaker and their audience [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunoia)

5. Spent well, a sabbatical can better shape the direction of the rest of your life

6. Jesus was likely not born in an actual manger [*](https://undeceptions.com/history/away-in-a-manger-was-jesus-really-born-in-a-stable/)

7. Raising a child can help supercharge your creative juices 

8. The children of the Moken sea gypsies have developed the ability to refract their eyes and see clearly underwater without goggles [*](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160229-the-sea-nomad-children-who-see-like-dolphins)

9. What seems logical can sometimes be unhelpful

10. Riding an electric motorcycle is really fun
