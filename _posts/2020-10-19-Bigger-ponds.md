> I wrote this for her who was starting a teaching job in a new school. 

My love absconds to bigger ponds

In a new role to feed tadpoles

To let eggs grow their legs

And watch hatchlings turn to fledglings

Like a mother over ducklings

She spreads her wings and sings

To ears unpierced and eyes that prize

The love of story and tales of glory  

She opens minds in due time  

And makes way for come what may
